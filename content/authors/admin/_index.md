## About Me

Ruisheng Cao currently works as a research scientist at [Alibaba Qwen Coder Team](https://github.com/QwenLM). He obtained CS PhD at [X-LANCE Lab](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/) supervised by professor [Kai Yu](https://x-lance.github.io/kaiyu/), in Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). His research interests mainly lie in structured natural language understanding (including semantic parsing, text-to-SQL, code intelligence and task-oriented dialogue systems), model-based data generation or augmentation with cycle learning and iterative training, and large language model (LLM) or vision language model (VLM) based multi-modal agents in fields like coding, software engineering, data science and engineering, website navigation and computer control.
